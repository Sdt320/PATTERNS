# PATTERNS
## Key Concepts for Creating Patterns
Loops:

Nested loops are fundamental in generating patterns. The outer loop typically handles the number of rows, while the inner loop handles the columns and the actual printing of characters.
Control Variables:

Variables like i and j control the iteration of the loops and can be used to determine the number of elements printed per row.
Conditionals:

Sometimes, you may need to use conditional statements (like if statements) within your loops to decide whether or not to print a certain character.
Formatting:

Proper use of printf formatting to align the characters/symbols in the desired pattern.
Practicing these patterns can help you become more comfortable with loops and conditionals in C programming, and they provide a solid foundation for understanding more complex logic and algorithms.
